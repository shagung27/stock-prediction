# Stock Price Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **stock visualization and prediction dashboard** built using **Plotly Dash**. It includes:

* LSTM model prediction for NSE-TATAGLOBAL
* Visualization of stock trends and volume for Facebook, Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft
* Interactive dashboard with dropdown selection and multiple charts
* A supporting Jupyter Notebook for model training steps

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shagung27/stock-prediction
cd stock-prediction
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Windows)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

* Command Prompt:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* PowerShell:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you face an issue with TensorFlow installation, ensure you're using Python 3.12 or lower (TensorFlow may not support 3.13+).

## 🚀 Running the Dashboard

```bash
python stock_app.py
```

Then open the browser at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```

## 📓 LSTM Model Training

You can view and run the training process of the LSTM model using the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook lstm_training.ipynb
```

This will walk you through:

* Loading and preprocessing data
* Creating input sequences
* Training an LSTM model
* Saving the trained model
